# hanser

## Features

- Simplified training and evalution, running on CPU, GPU and **TPU**, more powerful than Keras
- Easily extended to supervised learning tasks (Classification, Detection, Segmentation, NAS, Super Resolution, Keypoint Detection)
- High quality and out-of-the-box reimplementation of popular computer vision models, modules and tricks **with reproduced experimental results**
    1. Classification (ResNet-D, Res2Net, RegNet, SENet, ECA-Net, ...)
    2. Detection (RetinaNet, ATSS, FCOS, GFL, GFLV2, BiFPN, CIoU)
    3. Segmentation (DeepLabV3, DeepLabV3+)
    4. Data Augmentation and Regularization (RandAugment, CutMix, DropPath, DropBlock, ...)
- Repeatable training code and detailed **training log** for all reimplementation
